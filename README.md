FEWD assignment 1

## Introductions  
Hello Emily,  
Here is a litte brief about me.  

![picture of Manisha](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60672296/74077191-b103d680-49d2-11ea-968b-74ee8c1054ed.png)
My name is _Manisha Gupta and_ I am currently a student at _**San Diego Continuing Education**_. 

I started my career as an instructor and then moved on to programming in Object Oriented languages and Oracle Suite.  I stopped working when I started my family and have been a full time mom for the last 18 years. I now want to return to a new career in web development. It seems like a big challenge that I feel I need to take head on.  
I want to become a full stack developer and so far have completed the following courses at SDCE to brush up my skills:  
* MS-Excel
* Database Management (MS-Access, MySQL)
* PHP, Python 
* Linux Server Essentials Certificate program
* Project Management Certificate program
* FEWD1
* FEWD2(ongoing)  

In my spare time, I like to:  
1. garden [a link to my pinterest board] (https://pin.it/kg5ka26v2zzvy3)
2. read
3. tinker at home
4. volunteer at my kids school
5. support my daughters Girl Scout troop 
6. learn new applications (new interest)  

So here I am looking forward to a new career.
